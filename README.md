## Get the missing model

This project comes without the actual model as I don't want to republish someone else's work. I have downloaded it from the [PINTO model zoo](https://github.com/PINTO0309/PINTO_model_zoo).

I opened [this folder in the repository](https://github.com/PINTO0309/PINTO_model_zoo/tree/main/307_YOLOv7)

That shows [this batchfile](https://github.com/PINTO0309/PINTO_model_zoo/blob/main/307_YOLOv7/download_single_batch.sh) for using the single model 

That points to this [actual zipped tar file](https://s3.ap-northeast-2.wasabisys.com/pinto-model-zoo/307_YOLOv7/no-postprocess/resources.tar.gz) which contains the "yolov7-tiny_256x320.onnx" file. 

Copy "yolov7-tiny_256x320.onnx" this into Assets\Application\Model folder before opening the project
